# Estimating Sources Masses from Gravitational Waves with Deep Learning

Project from September - 2019

This repository contains code for the **Estimating Sources Masses from Gravitational Waves with Deep Learning** project.

### Samples
Gravitational Wave samples. Feature space are extremely noisy and redshifted. Objetive is to estimate the masses of the gravitational wave sources from these datapoints.

### Error/SNR Distribution
SNR stands for Signal-Noise Ratio.
