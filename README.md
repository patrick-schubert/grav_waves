# Estimating Source Masses from Gravitational Wave Data with Deep Learning

Project from September - 2019

This repository contains code for the **Estimating Source Masses from Gravitational Wave Data with Deep Learning** project.

### Samples
Feature space are extremely noisy and redshifted. Objetive is to estimate the masses of the gravitational wave sources from these datapoints.

### Error/SNR Distribution
Plotted fractional error to the magnitude of the snr. SNR stands for Signal-Noise Ratio.
